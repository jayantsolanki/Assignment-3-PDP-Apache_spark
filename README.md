# Connected-Components-Apache_spark

## Project Summary

### Analysis of connected Components using Map-Reduce
* Applied pointer jumping technique in Apache Spark using Scala to compute connected components of an extremely large undirected graph distributed along multiple computing nodes.
* Algorithm is based upon the Paper published by R. Kiveris, S. Lattanzi, V. Mirrokni, V. Rastogi, S. Vassilvitskii which used Large Star and Small Star to implement pointer jumping. Convergence is achieved in root of logn.
